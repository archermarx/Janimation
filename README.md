# Janimation.jl

An animation for Jana! (@janapavlasek)

To generate the animation, open julia in this folder and activate the `Pkg` REPL. From there, activate the environment and instantiate
the required dependencies.

```
julia> ] activate.

julia> ] instantiate
```

Once the dependencies have downloaded and compiled, simply `include` `janimation.jl`!

```
julia> include "janimation.jl"
```

The video will generate. All settings are tweakable in the `janimation.jl` script.

Good luck Jana!
